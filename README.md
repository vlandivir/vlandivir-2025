## Telegram Bot Commands and Examples

This project includes a Telegram bot with several useful commands. Notes are saved automatically from any text or photo you send to the bot.

### Creating a new note

Send a message or a photo caption to save a diary note for today. To store a note for a different date, start the first line with the desired date. The bot understands several common date formats.

```
02.01.2025
My note text
```

Supported date formats:

- `YYYY.MM.DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `DD.MM` or `MM/DD` (year defaults to the current one)
- `DD MMMM` (Russian month names, e.g. `2 января`)
- `DD MMM YYYY` (English month names, e.g. `2 Jan 2025`)

If you omit the date, the note is saved with today's date.

### `/d` or `/dairy`

Retrieves diary entries for a specific date.

- **date** (optional) — use `DD.MM.YYYY` to show a single day or `DD.MM`/`DD month` to see the same day across years.

Example:

```
/d 25.03.2024
```

### `/s`

Provides Serbian translations. Only works in private chats.

- **text** — Serbian word or phrase.

Example:

```
/s zdravo
```

### `/history`

Generates an HTML page with all messages longer than 42 characters.

**Features:**

- Filters messages longer than 42 characters
- Generates a beautiful HTML page with chat history
- Provides a secret GUID-based link
- Includes message dates and images

Example:

```
/history
```

### `/t` or `/task`

Creates a new todo item.

- **content** — description of the todo item.
- `@tag` — add tags.
- `.context` — specify contexts.
- `!project` — assign projects (multiword names are allowed).
- `(A)` — set priority with a letter in parentheses.
- `:<date>` or `:<date> HH:MM` — optional due date. `<date>` accepts the same formats as in the note examples above.
- You can also use words like `tomorrow` or day names (`sunday`, `понедельник`, etc.) for the due date.

To update an existing task, start the command with its key:
`/t T-20250710-03 ...`. New tags and contexts are appended while
projects and due dates are replaced. The text part can be empty.
Use `-canceled`, `-done`, `-in-progress`, `-started`, or `-snoozed[days]` (e.g., `-snoozed4` or `-snoozed 4`) to set the status.
Snoozed tasks are hidden from `/tl` until their snooze period expires.

Example:

```
/task (B) @work .office !Big Project :2025.07.31 09:00 Prepare report
```

### `/tl`

Lists unfinished todo items. You can filter by the same `@tag`, `.context` and `!project` tokens as in `/task`.

Example:

```
/tl @work .office
```

### `/th`

Generates an HTML page with all tasks and their history stored on DigitalOcean Spaces.

Tasks are organized into three categories:

- **Unfinished**: Active tasks sorted by due date and key
- **Snoozed**: Tasks that are currently snoozed, sorted by snooze expiration date and key
- **Finished**: Completed or canceled tasks sorted by creation date

The snoozed until date is displayed for snoozed tasks.
History lines show only what changed instead of repeating the full task text.

### `/qa`

Adds a new question for the current chat.

Example:

```
/qa How many apples do you have?
```

### `/ql`

Lists all questions for the current chat.

Example:

```
/ql
```

### `/help`

Shows a list of all available commands.
