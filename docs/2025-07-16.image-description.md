# Image Description Feature

## Overview
The bot now automatically describes images when they are sent to the chat. This feature uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to generate descriptions in Russian.

## Setup

### 1. OpenAI API Key
Add your OpenAI API key to your environment variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Database Migration
The database schema has been updated to include image descriptions. Run the migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_image_description
```

## How it Works

1. When a user sends an image to the bot, the image is:
   - Downloaded from Telegram
   - Uploaded to your storage service (AWS S3)
   - Sent to OpenAI's API for description
     (the photo caption is included in the prompt if present)
   - The description is saved to the database
   - The description is returned to the user in the chat

2. The description is stored in the `Image` table in the `description` field

3. The bot responds with both the save confirmation and the image description

## Database Schema Changes

The `Image` model now includes:
- `description: String?` - The AI-generated description of the image

## Error Handling

- If the OpenAI API key is not configured, the bot will return "Не удалось описать изображение"
- If the API call fails, the bot will handle the error gracefully and still save the image
- The image is always saved even if description fails

## Cost Considerations

- Each image description uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model
- The prompt is optimized to be concise (max 300 tokens)
- Consider monitoring your OpenAI usage if you expect high volume

## Customization

You can modify the prompt in `src/services/llm.service.ts` to change:
- The language of the description
- The level of detail
- The style of the description
