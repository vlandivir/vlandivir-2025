# Code Style

This project uses **Prettier** and **ESLint** to enforce consistent code style.

Key rules:

- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas in multiline objects and arrays
- Linting follows TypeScript ESLint recommended rules
- Code is automatically formatted and linted before each commit

Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` to apply fixes manually.
