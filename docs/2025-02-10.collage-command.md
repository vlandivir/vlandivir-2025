# Collage Command Feature

## Overview
The bot now supports creating image collages from multiple images sent in a single message. This feature allows users to combine multiple photos into a single collage with a specific layout.

## How to Use

### Method 1: Command with Images
1. Select multiple images (2 or more) in Telegram
2. Add a caption with `/collage` or `/c`
3. Send the message
4. The bot will create a collage and send it back

### Method 2: Direct Command
1. Send `/collage` or `/c` as a text command
2. The bot will respond with instructions

## Layout
- **Main Image**: The first image in the message keeps its original size and spans the full width
- **Additional Images**: All other images are resized to fit in a row below the main image
- **Spacing**: White lines separate the images for better visual separation

## Requirements
- Minimum 2 images per collage
- Images must be sent in a single message
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP

## Technical Details
- Images are processed using the Sharp library
- The collage is uploaded to DigitalOcean Spaces storage
- The final collage is sent back as a photo with caption "Коллаж из изображений"

## Error Handling
- If fewer than 2 images are sent, the bot responds with an error message
- Network or processing errors are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Images are not saved to the database when creating collages

## Examples
```
User sends: [Image1, Image2, Image3] with caption "/collage"
Bot responds: [Collage image] with caption "Коллаж из изображений"
```

## Implementation
- **Service**: `CollageCommandsService`
- **Command**: `/collage` or `/c`
- **Dependencies**: Sharp for image processing, StorageService for uploads
- **Integration**: Works with existing photo handling in TelegramBotService
