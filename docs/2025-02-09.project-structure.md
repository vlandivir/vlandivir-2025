2. Modular Structure
In a modular structure, the application is divided into separate modules, each with its own controller, service, and other related files. This structure is scalable and helps in organizing code better.

Components:

`common/`: This folder contains reusable components like filters and guards.
`modules/`: This folder contains different feature modules of the application.
`users/`: This folder contains files related to the users module.
`users.controller.ts`: Handles incoming requests for the users module.
`users.module.ts`: Defines the users module and imports necessary dependencies.
`users.service.ts`: Contains business logic related to users.
`products/`: This folder contains files related to the products module.
`products.controller.ts`: Handles incoming requests for the products module.
`products.module.ts`: Defines the products module and imports necessary dependencies.
`products.service.ts`: Contains business logic related to products.

```bash
nest generate module module-name  
nest generate controller controller-name  
nest generate service service-name   

cd src
mkdir common 
mkdir config 
mkdir modules 
mkdir shared 
mkdir utils 
mkdir assets
```
